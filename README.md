# Linear-Regression
Here in this project, the main goal is to figure out the Target variable and check based on what factors a clothing company should concentrate on marketing via mobile app or website. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
